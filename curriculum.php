				<h1>Curriculum Breakdown</h1>
				<p class="breakdown centered">Our instructors will follow a proven curriculum that will guide your child through the necessary steps to mastering the different types of Jutsus and base chakra control through the following areas:</p>

						<a href="" class="accordion-icon plus">&#43;</a> 
						<h3>Ninjutsu</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="accordion__description hidden">
						<p>Ninjutsu is at the heart of every ninja's arsenal. Ninjutsu gathers from the chakra reserves of a shinobi and is unleashed as many different spectacular techniques that can give a ninja the upper hand in battle if used correctly. At KNA, your child will learn how to properly channel and control their chakra to unleash ninjutsu. Some sample ninjutsu they will learn includes:</p> 
						<ul>
							<li>Shadow Clone Jutsu</li>
							<li>Substitution Justu</li>
							<li>Transformation Justu</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Taijutsu</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="accordion__description hidden">
						<p>Taijustu is the muscle and backbone of a ninja's arsenal. Taijustu also uses chakra to add power, speed and precision to martial arts in hand to hand combat. Students will learn the basics in attacking with taijustu through sparring matches and guided learning from instructors.</p> 
					</div>

					<div class="accordion__heading">
						<a href="" class="accordion-icon plus">&#43;</a> 
						<h3>Genjutsu</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="accordion__description hidden">
						<p>Just as ninjutsu and taijustu are of the heart and body, genjustu is of the mind. Genjutsu targets the mind with chakra to overwhelm opponents. Since genjutsu is not practiced by all shinobi, students are not taught base genjutsu by the academy. Students are taught how to channel their chakra to be able to disrupt the genjutsu chakra flow in themselves and their allies. This defense is essential for when they do encounter genjutsu users in combat.</p>

						<h3>Battle Situations</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="accordion__description hidden">
						<p>Students will receive guidance in both the execution and planning of battle strategy. By taking a look at historical battles and mission situations students will learn how to adapt and overcome even the toughest challenges.</p>

						<h3>Ninja Tools</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="accordion__description hidden">
						<p>A shinobi must use the many tools at their disposal to be successful. Students will be trained in the use of many battle weaponry such as:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Kunai</li>
							<li>Shuriken</li>
							<li>Swords</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Their training will encourage safety and proper use while sharpening their precision and speed so they can be successful in an mission.

						<h3>Basic Medical Justu</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="accordion__description hidden">
						<p>Students will get a starting look at medical ninjutsu. This will give them a chance to recover in case a situation goes wrong. Students who have shown strong aptitude in this area often go on to be full medical ninja like Lady Tsunade.</p>
